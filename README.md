A "just add water" Typo3 ready-to-be-installed Vagrant configuration file.

Since I just got new project that requires a Typo3 plugin I've rolled out a Vagrant box so I can mess with it without fear of messing up my work instatllation.

## How-to

1. Install Vagrant
2. Clone this repo to a folder
3. vagrant up
